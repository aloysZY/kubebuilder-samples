                      ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                      the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                      of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                      traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                      the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                      be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                      routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                      features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                      within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                      a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                      when picking a node.

                      can use this port to determine if a given node holds endpoints for this
                      service or not.  If this field is specified when creating a Service

                      dropping the traffic if there are no local endpoints. The default value,

                            Valid values are either:

                            * Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:

                            All ports within a ServiceSpec must have unique names. When considering
                            the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the
                            EndpointPort.

                            operation will fail.  If not specified, a port will be allocated if this
                            Service requires one.  If this field is specified when creating a
                            Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be
                            wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type
                            from NodePort to ClusterIP).

                            This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be

                      publishNotReadyAddresses indicates that any agent which deals with endpoints for this
                      Service should disregard any indications of ready/not-ready.
                      The primary use case for setting this field is for a StatefulSet's Headless Service to
                      propagate SRV DNS records for its Pods for the purpose of peer discovery.
                      The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for
                      Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the
                      Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints
                      through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                      type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                      options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                      "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                      to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                      specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                      EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                      allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                      than a virtual IP.
                      "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                      routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                      "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                      (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                      as the clusterIP.
                      "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                      Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.
